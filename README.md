# MS-Paint-GPL-Palette
MS Paint Gimp Color Palette
---
A color palette for GIMP, Krita, etc. with the default Microsoft Paint colors. I gave each color a name for clarity; the names are not official Microsoft names.

## How To Use In Krita
- Download `MsPaint.gpl`.
- in Krita, go to Settings > Manage Resources > Import Resources.
- Select `MsPaint.gpl` from wherever it is in your file manager.
